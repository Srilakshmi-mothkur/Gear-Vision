# Gear Vision

**Gear Vision** is a deep learning model for detecting and classifying various car parts, designed to assist firms in automating and optimizing parts identification and inventory management.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Framework:**
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the deep learning model with MobileNetV2 architecture.
- **Image Processing:**
  - **OpenCV**: Applied for various image processing tasks.
  - **PIL (Pillow)**: Utilized for loading and resizing images.
- **Data Augmentation:**
  - **ImageDataGenerator**: Employed for augmenting the dataset with transformations such as rotation, shifting, shearing, and flipping.
- **Programming Language:**
  - **Python**: The primary language for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Additional Libraries:**
  - **NumPy** and **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib**: For visualizing learning curves and predictions.

## Results

The model performs well, handling noisy images and providing accurate predictions for real-time images, making it suitable for applications where customers submit live images of car parts.
